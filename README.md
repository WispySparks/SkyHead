# SkyHeadMod
This is a 1.8.9 Minecraft Mod used to display Skywars Levels on Hypixel, to get started just put it in your mods folder and use the command
/skyhead key <apikeyhere> and it should start working. 
You can get your apikey on hypixel by doing the command, /api. It will store your key in a config file for every launch. To turn the mod off and on you can use /skyhead on and /skyhead off. 
You can also abbreviate /skyhead to /sh. Turning the mod on and off will be remembered between launches. 
If it says "Limit" next to a players name that means you have hit the limit of requests for that minute and you will have to wait a little bit. 
This was built off of the recommended forge build for 1.8.9 This mod is use at your own risk, 
I am not responsible for any harm that may come to you or false bans that could potentially happen.
